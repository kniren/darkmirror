Dark Mirror
===========

A color scheme for Vim, by Alex Sanchez. You can get it at:
[github](https://github.com/kniren/darkmirror).

This is my first attempt to make a clean, minimalistic and beautiful dark color
scheme that works on XTerms. Note that it is at a very early stage, and because of
that, you may encounter some color mismatches.

I've tested it with Java, C, Python, XML, HTML, Markdown and VimScript, and
I would love to see how does it looks for you, so if you use this, please, drop me
a line or send me a screenshot to <kniren@gmail.com>

Xresources Colors
-----------------

To display this colorscheme as I have envisioned I suggest you to use this colors
for your Xterms (I use URxvt myself, but you can tweak them to make them work
with your setup):
 

    " //////////// URxvt Colors ////////////" 
    "
        "*foreground: #DDDDDD
        "*background: #050505
        "!black
        "*color0: #393939
        "*color8: #121212
        "!red
        "*color1: #da4939
        "*color9: #ff6c5c
        "!green
        "*color2: #509F7E
        "*color10: #61C29A
        "!yellow
        "*color3: #cc7833
        "*color11: #bc9458
        "!blue
        "*color4: #6d9cbe
        "*color12: #d0d0ff
        "!magenta
        "*color5: #9966D9
        "*color13: #9954DE
        "!cyan
        "*color6: #435d75
        "*color14: #6e98a4
        "!white
        "*color7: #dedede
        "*color15: #dddddd

Why I do this?
--------------

Well, I was pretty comfortable using gvim with molokai colors, but since I've
discovered tmux, I've found myself coding exclusively inside my terminal, and
although the jellybeans colorscheme that I've been using was kind of nice,
I wanted a cleaner scheme that highlights only the necessary bits and that worked
well with my Xdefaults colors.
